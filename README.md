# GitHub Repositories with Links to Academic Papers: Open Access, Traceability, and Evolution

## Abstract

Traceability between published scientific breakthroughs and their implementation is essential, especially in the case of open-source scientific software which implements bleeding-edge science in its code. However, aligning the link between GitHub repositories and academic papers can prove difficult, and the impact created by publishing both academic papers and their associated software remains unknown. This paper investigates the role of academic paper references contained in these repositories. We conduct a large-scale study of 20 thousand GitHub repositories to establish prevalence of references to academic papers. We use a mixed-methods approach to identify Open Access (OA), traceability and evolutionary aspects of the links. Although referencing a paper is not typical, we find that a vast majority of referenced academic papers are OA. These repositories tend to be affiliated with academic communities. More than half of the papers do not link back to any repository. A case study of referenced arXiv paper shows that most of these papers are high-impact, influential, and do align with academia, being referenced by repositories written in different programming languages. From a software evolution standpoint, we find very few changes of papers being referenced and links to them.

## Qualitative coding
  Our coding results of 377 links to GitHub repositories for RQ1 (Prevalence and Open Access), RQ2 (Relationship and Traceability), and RQ3 (Evolution) are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7gkxqJpzsa4T2ZuZg-VfAvD9U4r-XbpmwdlkK3k_RZ5Jc8bhgLK6I6xHj_KSTHTZaoJg-SqcE2yPj/pubhtml).
  
 **coding guide for RQ1.2**
 - *open access* - the referenced academic paper is available online including authors' preprint.
 - *not open access* - the referenced academic paper is not OA, and authors do not provide their preprint.
